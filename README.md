# Multi-Chain-Wallet-Generator
 This is a Multi-Chain-Wallet-Generator I have created using nothing but Python. The user simplely choses a desired blockchain, presses the 'Generate' button and saves their new wallet information!

I have included both the python and .exe versions

Clone the repo here: https://github.com/Recoverrrr/Multi-Chain-Wallet-Generator.git

The .exe version will appear as a virus due to Windows flagging .exes, if you dont want to run the .exe file simply run the python script included to get the same result.

This is my first ever program shared on GitHub, please lmk if you enjoy it or have any feedback! Thank you.
